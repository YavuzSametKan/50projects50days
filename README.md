# Small Frontend Projects
This repository is a platform created for personal development in the field of web development. 
My focus is on strengthening my front-end coding skills and building a solid foundation.
Each project is designed to focus on learning a specific concept or skill, thereby enabling me to learn something new every day.

## Technologies Used
In addition to fundamental technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, SASS may also be utilized during this process.
